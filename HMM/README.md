# HMM & 1st Order Logic Assignment
### Carter Kruse (November 6, 2023)

### README
The following provides instructions on how to run the code.

### HMM
To implement HMM for the Mazeworld Problem, run `python3 HMMProblem.py`. This will output the results and create a terminal/console GUI.

### Comments
The file `HMMProblem.py` may be modified (as desired) to run according to different mazes. The mazes are written in ASCII text, which is handled by the `Maze.py` file. The maze files should be in the same folder as the script.

The code implements both the filtering and forward-backward smoothing algorithms (in parallel), displaying the results of each for every iteration.

### Extra
*IMPORTANT* - The bonus files that are to be considered for extra credit points are outlined in the report, and included within the primary assignment.
