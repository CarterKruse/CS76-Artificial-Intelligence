### README
The following provides instructions on how to run the code.

### Chess
To implement minimax, iterative deepening, and alpha beta for Chess, run `python3 test_chess.py`. This will output the results and create a terminal/console GUI.

### Comments
The files `test_chess.py` may be modified (as desired) to run according to the different search algorithms, with the correct depths.

*IMPORTANT*
The bonus files that are to be considered for extra credit points are as follows: `AlphaBetaAI_Zobrist.py`, `MinimaxAI_Mobility.py`, `test_chess_openings.py`
