    "#### Solving The Inverse Kinematics Problem Using Newton's Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton's method is one of the most widely used methods for finding solutions to systems of non-linear equations. It converges at a remarkable speed when started sufficiently close to a root, though there is generally no strict guarantee of convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a function $  \\bm{f \\left( \\bm{x} \\right)} $, Newton's method tries to find a solution to the equation $ \\bm{f} = \\mathbf{0} $ using steps of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bm{x_{i + 1}} = \\bm{x_i} - \\left( \\nabla \\bm{f \\left( \\bm{x_{i}} \\right)} \\right)^{-1} \\bm{f \\left( \\bm{x_{i}} \\right)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of inverse kinematics, we want to apply Newton's method to solve an equation of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bm{p \\left( \\theta_1, \\ldots, \\theta_n \\right)} = \\bm{p_{\\mathrm{target}}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for a given reference position $ \\bm{p_{\\mathrm{target}}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the unknowns are the angles $ \\theta_1, \\ldots, \\theta_n $, and the function whose root we seek maps to a two-dimensional domain. It is not immediately obvious how to apply Newton's method, since the Jacobian of the function has the shape $ 2 \\times n $ and hence cannot be inverted using standard techniques like LU decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a consequence of the fact that many different configurations can be used to reach the same $ \\bm{p_{\\mathrm{target}}} $. Fortunately, we can use the *pseudo-inverse*, a generalization of the inverse to non-square matrices. In this specific case, the Jacobian is *wide* (it has more columns than rows), so the pseudo-inverse will find the solution to a linear system which has the smallest $ \\| \\cdot \\|_2 $-norm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we implement a function `newton(theta, target)` that takes a 1-dimensional array of angles as a starting guess as well as a 2D target position (specified as a 1-dimensional array) as input. The implementation performs a fixed `8` iterations of Newton's method to try to solve the equation $ \\bm{p \\left( \\theta_1, \\ldots, \\theta_n \\right)} = \\bm{p_{\\mathrm{target}}} $ and returns the final set of parameters $ \\theta_1, \\ldots, \\theta_n $ as an 1-dimensional `numpy` array. The function `la.pinv` is used to compute the *pseudo-inverse*."
